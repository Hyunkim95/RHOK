## Random Hack of Kindness Winter Winning Entry 

Our team placed first in the RHOK where we developed a change maker's project - our project was IaMee, a mobile application that promotes the management of mental health for the younger generation. 

Our focus for the hackthon was:

"To create a solution that is scalable for the future"

As the application was going to used for future cases, we had to ensure that the application was not hardcoded and fully functional. My role was the lead front end; despite having a surplus of UI designers and back end specialist - my friend and I who were recent graduates were given the responsibility of managing and developing the front end. 

Initially we only had designs, but after 48 hours we had managed to create an application which demonstrated the user flow of:
• Registration and Sign Up
• Creating an activity
• Completing an activity
• Inviting a friend through email
